  - Create a New App:

    - Once logged in, click on the "Create an App" button.

  - Fill in App Details:

    - Provide the necessary details for your new app, including the name and description.
    - You may need to agree to the terms and conditions.

  - Obtain Client ID and Client Secret:

    - After creating the app, you'll be provided with a Client ID and Client Secret. Keep these credentials secure, as they are essential for authenticating your app with the Spotify API.

Always refer to the latest [Spotify Developer Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/) for the most up-to-date information and specific details regarding the API, authentication, and other features.

### **Create a `.env` file**

   - Add the following lines:
      - CLIENT_ID="The 'Client ID' provided by Spotify"
      - CLIENT_SECRET="The 'Client Secret' provided by Spotify"

## **Python Script**

This Python script utilizes the Spotify API to enrich a DataFrame containing Spotify track information by adding the URL of the first image associated with each track's album. The enriched DataFrame is then saved to a new CSV file.

### Importing Libraries:

The code imports necessary libraries
  - '**dotenv**' for loading environment variables.
  - '**os**' for operating system functionalities, base64 for encoding.
  - '**requests**' for making HTTP requests.
  - '**pandas**' for data manipulation.
    
### Loading Environment Variables:

It uses ***load_dotenv()*** to load environment variables from a file, presumably containing **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET** for Spotify API authentication.

### Getting Spotify Access Token:

The function ***get_token()*** retrieves an access token from the Spotify API using client credentials. It encodes the client ID and client secret in Base64 and sends a POST request to Spotify's token endpoint.

### Searching for a Track:

The function ***search_track(track_name, artist_name, token)*** searches for a track on Spotify using the provided track name and artist name, returning the track ID if a result is found.

### Getting Track Details:

The function ***get_track_details(track_id, token)*** retrieves details of a track from Spotify using the track ID, specifically the URL of the first image associated with the track's album.

### Processing a DataFrame:

The script reads a CSV file named **'spotify-2023.csv'** into a Pandas DataFrame.
It iterates through each row of the DataFrame, searching for track details and updating the DataFrame with the URL of the first image associated with the track's album.
The results are stored in a new column named **'image_url'**.
The updated DataFrame is saved to a new CSV file named **'updated_file.csv'**.

### Printing Columns:

The script prints the column names of the DataFrame to the console.

**Note:**

The script includes error handling for unsuccessful API requests and missing data.
There's a check for the presence of the 'artist(s)_name' column in the DataFrame before proceeding with the search.
Error messages are printed to the console in case of issues.
